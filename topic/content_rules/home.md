# Creation Rules on Babelyx

### Form of Creations

Every creation consists of three optional parts:

- **Title** : A title. Optional. Fully public.
- **Cover** : An image. Optional. Fully public.
- **Content** : A story. Optional. Encrypted protection!

Each of these parts can be omitted. This means you can publish a creation with just a sentence, just an image, or just a standalone story.

The **title** and **cover** are completely public, accessible to anyone, just like on the traditional internet. Therefore, you should only include information in the title or cover that you want to be public.

**Content** is the core part of your rights and income, sealed with Bitcoin-level encryption and permanently belonging to you.

- No one else can view, alter, or copy it without your authorization.
- A piece of content can include multiple paragraphs; each paragraph can be in various forms such as text, images, videos, files, etc. Therefore, you can tell a complete and rich story within the content, such as serialized novels, photography, market research reports, professional experience sharing, and more.
- You can also set up smart trading contracts in the next interface to generate a continuous stream of income! See How to Monetize Creations.

### Content Restrictions

Babele itself does not impose any restrictions on content!

You only need to adhere to the rules of other sources, such as:

- Complying with speech restrictions in your region. You cannot post content that conflicts with the laws of your area.
- Respecting copyright. You cannot unlawfully publish or use content you do not own the rights to.
- Following community etiquette. You must not negatively impact or harm other users.

On this basis, you can:

- Cite links from other platforms. No problem!
- Post commercial-related content. No problem!
