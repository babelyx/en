First step, click on "Create Aipp".

First, give your AI mini-application a simple and memorable name, for example, just call it "My English Personal Assistant".

Then, write a short self-introduction for your AI mini-application. For example: `I am your private English secretary, I will translate any of your language text into idiomatic English`

Next, let's write system instructions to tell the assistant what kind of work you want it to do. For example: `You are an English interpreter. You will translate any language text entered by the user into English`

Finally, click the "Save" button, wait a moment, and there you go! It's that simple!

Now let's try it out! Go into the AI mini-application you just created, and say something...

Awesome, you now have a private English personal assistant!

You can also share the assistant with your friends, so go ahead and show it off!
